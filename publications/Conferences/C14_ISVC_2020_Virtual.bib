abstract="In this paper, the task of gender and age recognition is performed on pedestrian still images, which are usually captured in-the-wild with no near face-frontal information. Moreover, another difficulty originates from the underlying class imbalance in real examples, especially for the age estimation problem. The scope of the paper is to examine how different loss functions in convolutional neural networks (CNN) perform under the class imbalance problem. For this purpose, as a backbone, we employ the Residual Network (ResNet). On top of that, we attempt to benefit from appearance-based attributes, which are inherently present in the available data. We incorporate this knowledge in an autoencoder, which we attach to our baseline CNN for the combined model to jointly learn the features and increase the classification accuracy. Finally, all of our experiments are evaluated on two publicly available datasets.",
